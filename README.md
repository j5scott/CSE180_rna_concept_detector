Main Project:  pcFsd.py
  - given test data, find all the patterns
  
  * 
    have a little more to do: buggy, but now workable enough to finish, 

    If I have time I'll do that-
    
    thinking about using it to generated sequence files with similar distribution of 
    patterns as a real sequence fed to it

Test Data Generator: Genzen.py
  - originally to test pcFsd.py, and 
    
    could probably incorporate the 'random weighted dice' idea into generation
    

Helper: Labler.py - haven't used at all yet, maybe will be handy to output protein seq's
